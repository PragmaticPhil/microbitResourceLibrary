All resource files must follow the conventions below:

RESERVED RANGES:

00000-09999:  images for the microbit 5x5 LED.
10000-19999:  String literals
20000-29999:  Full screen images for SSD1306 (so 128x64)
30000-39999:  Partial (not full) images for SSD1306
40000-49999:  Fonts
50000-89999:  Spare
90000-99999:  Specials.  These are Partials but without dimension data

STRING LENGTH OF FILE NAME:
The reserved ranges above are PREFIXES.
You would check out a 4-char prefix and reserve it.
You can then save ANY number of resources using that prefix - it is acceptable for file names to be 5 or 6 digits long (perhaps even 7 if the need arises).
... so you could name a file "000000.txt" as well as "0000012"
... This allows us to store lots of files in numberical sequence - great for animations


DATA FORMAT:
The resources are designed to be used in MakeCode.
So they are all .txt files.
Format specifics vary according to the resource type (which is encoded in the first digit of the file name)
