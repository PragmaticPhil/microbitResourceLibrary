All resource files must follow the conventions below:

RESERVED RANGES:

00000-09999:  QR codes
10000-14999:  images for the microbit 5x5 LED.
15000-19999:  ASCII - representations of ASCII codes in 5x5
20000-29999:  String literals
30000-39999:  Full screen images for SSD1306 (so 128x64)
40000-49999:  Partial (not full) images for SSD1306
50000-59999:  Fonts
60000-69999:  Banners (full width SSD) - 12x128
70000-79999:  Stripes (full height SSD) - 64x12
80000-89999:  Spare
90000-99999:  Specials.  These are Partials but without dimension data

FILE NAMES:
File names are comprised of integers.
This makes them easier to access from code using indices.

STRING LENGTH OF FILE NAME:
The reserved ranges above are PREFIXES.
You would check out a 4-char prefix and reserve it.
You can then save ANY number of resources using that prefix - it is acceptable for file names to be 5 or 6 digits long (perhaps even 7 if the need arises).
... so you could name a file "000000.txt" as well as "0000012"
... This allows us to store lots of files in numberical sequence - great for animations

DATA FORMAT:
The resources are designed to be used in MakeCode.
So they are all .txt files.
Format specifics vary according to the resource type (which is encoded in the first digit of the file name)
